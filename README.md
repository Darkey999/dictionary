I created this app as a part of Udacity tutorial for Android, to improve my skill in XML and Java.

App allows the user to learn forty different words and phrases, e.g. family and numbers. 

Writing this app improved my knowledge about creating fragments, custom array adapters and using MediaPlayer in Android,
as well as creating Java Classes.
